ASSIGNMENT 1:
Module 2: Basic Python Concepts
 
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations [math_operations.py]
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
 Expected Output:
The output should include the result of each operation performed, for example:
 
Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting [personal_greeting.py]
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.  Takes a user's first name and last name as input.
2.  Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.
3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.
Expected Output:
The program should output a greeting like:

Module 3 : Control Structures
 
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd - [even_odd.py]
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.
Expected Output:
The program should output a message like:
The number 4 is even. 

Task 2: 
 
 Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop [sum_of_nummbers.py]
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.
Expected Output:
The program should output a message like:
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is 1275.

Assignment 3 - Module 4:

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function  (factorial.py)

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
 
Expected Output:
For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return: 120

Task 2:

Using the Math Module for Calculations (math_module_operations.py)
 
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:
        o    Square root of the number
        o    Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
        o    Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.
 Expected Output:
 For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:
    Square root: 5.0    
    Natural logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
    Sine: -0.13235175009777303

Module 5 - Assignments - Files, Exceptions, and Modules
Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors  [read_file.py]
Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:
1.   Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
2.   Prints its content line by line.
3.   Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.
 
Expected Output:

If the file exists:
This is python programming. Learning from tutedude.
Program videos are going basic and slow learning curve.

If the file does not exist:
Error: The file 'non_existent_file.txt' does not exist.

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.

Expected Output:
Enter some text to write to the file: Hello World, Python
Enter additional text to append to the file: welcome to Programming in Python
Final content of the file:
Hello World, Python
welcome to Programming in Python

Task2 :
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that: [read_write_append_files.py]
1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.

Expected Output:
Enter some text to write to the file: Hello World, Python
Enter additional text to append to the file: welcome to Programming in Python
Final content of the file:
Hello World, Python
welcome to Programming in Python
